Web Application Toolkit. Widgets and more.

Swat is an open-source [LGPL]([http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html) web-application
toolkit built using [PHP](http://www.php.net/). It is primarily developed and
maintained by [silverorange](http://www.silverorange.com), but participation and
contributions are welcome. Check out what it can do in the
[http://swat.silverorange.com/demo/](Swat demo).

Swat is *not* a full-stack web framework. Swat is an interface toolkit analogous to
[Gtk](http://gtk.org/ Gtk), but for web applications instead of native applications.
